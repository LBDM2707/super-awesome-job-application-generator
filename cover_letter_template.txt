My name is Long Le. I have been living in Syndey for almost four years and 
am planning to move to Perth thus I'm looking for a new job in the city. I recently
saw {{ company }} open {{ title }} on Linkedin and I am very interested in 
the opportunity. I believe the position will be a good step moving forward.

I have worked with AWS, Python, Snowflake and Tableau at my current 
position as Data Developer at CoreLogic since 2021. My experiences focus on developing 
ETL pipelines using Event-Driven Architecture with AWS technologies including
Lambda, SNS, SQS, S3 Bucket, DynamoDB, Cloud Formation, etc. In addition
to that, I also work extensively in data analysis with Snowflakes as well as
data visualisation with Tableau.

On the other hand, traditional software engineering is also my strong suit and 
I worked for more than three years as Django/Python developer at Gooesoft. I have 
comprehensive experience as well as knowledge with the framework as well as 
developing RESTful API.

Finally, I also worked on the side with Google Cloud's Firebase. The project is about
implementing an integrator/connector between platforms with webhooks and API. The main
idea of the project was to use Event-Driven Architecture and leverage the cloud to 
simplify and minimise infrastructure and complexity.

I hope I have presented myself as a qualified and suite candidate for the position. 
Please contact me, if you require any further information or have other questions 
for me. Thank you for your consideration. 

Best regards,
Long
